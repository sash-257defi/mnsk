<h4 id="score-reason">Score reason</h4>

<p>Utility : 1.5-1.7 euro per m2.</p>

<p>Internet: the same price as variant 1.</p>

<p>Basically, very interesting variant. We also have companies based there, very good service company, easy to negotiate with owner. Just problem, that it is not a huge openspace. Rest rooms on each floor, not private for each office.</p>

<h4 id="lenas-comments">Lenaâ€™s comments</h4>

<p>Good location. Denis said no open space and only a few offices. We need to see how many offices we need.</p>

<h4 id="advantages">Advantages:</h4>

<p>modern building, very comfortable to reach office(close two metro stations and bus and tram stop,) private parking. Also, there is some prestige, if your company is located in this building, there are a few famous Belarussian startups based. Near a few cafes, but not too cheap, in 10 minutes walking there is some cheap and good state eatery.Good owner, possible to negotiate the price.</p>

<h4 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages:</h4>

<p>there is no open space, only a few separate offices, but possible to rent them on the same floor.</p>

<h4 id="comments-about-this-office">Comments about this office:</h4>

<p>This variant based in the middle of city center. A lot of cafes near, private parking + underground parking. Metro station in 5 minutes walking. Most companies in BC are IT-companies(PandaDoc, Verv and others).</p>

<p>The owner is a private company, so you no need to pay tax on property (to compare with variant 1). There are a few officies that belong to owner on two floors (5 and 6).</p>

<p>Officies are ready,just need to buy furniture. Some of the officies close to each other. They have 200+ m2 officies and 100+ m2. We discussed with owner posobillity to ask some of their tenants move to another floor,in such case we can rent a few officies that located near one by one, so total it will be 600-650 m2. There are 3 different internet providers.</p>
