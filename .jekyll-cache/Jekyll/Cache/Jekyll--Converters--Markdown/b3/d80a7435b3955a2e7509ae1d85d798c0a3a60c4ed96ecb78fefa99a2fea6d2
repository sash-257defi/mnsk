<p>I like the location a lot, because you can get there from 3 metro lines.</p>

<p>They have parking(3) we need to find out what other options for parking, own entrance and own elevator are plus.</p>

<p>Design and furniture are nice too, but green color which is not Deriv colors.</p>

<p>They have nice relax zones and kitchen.</p>

<p>We just need to check on photos w Denis if they are from the office he looked there. IT company used to be there.</p>

<h4 id="score-reason">Score reason</h4>

<p>New building.</p>

<p>Space splitted for a few  cabinets. 4 restrooms (one with shower), individual entrance and individual elevator just for this office, separate server room, one small meeting room, kitchen (there is a water),general space with big meeting room and private terrace.</p>

<p>Some furniture previous tenant will leave, some possible to negotiate to buy.</p>

<p>3 parking places for free, to get more need to negotiate with head of service company.</p>

<p>Close to 2 metro stations, a few minutes walking.</p>

<p>3 internet providers.</p>

<p>Nice looking building, very good location, close a few cafes, just good and simple office.</p>

<p>But without emotions, for example Red bricks was like ‚ÄúWOW-effect‚Äù, here just good and simple.</p>

<p>I know this office, I was there a few times ,for your aims and targets will be good, if you don‚Äôt want to get additional emotion from people, when they come to work place. I think good variant, because next door office for 790 m2 owner try to rent for 30-35 euros nowadays. Owner is a government company.They usually do not rise prices too much or make problems for tenants, but it depends.</p>

<p>If compare all current variants and compare price/quality/location this one is favorite.</p>
