#### Lena's comments

I like the location a lot, because you can get there from 3 metro lines. 

They have parking(3) we need to find out what other options for parking, own entrance and own elevator are plus. 

Design and furniture are nice too, but green color which is not Deriv colors. 

They have nice relax zones and kitchen. 

We just need to check on photos w Denis if they are from the office he looked there. IT company used to be there.

#### Score reason

New building.

Space splitted for a few  cabinets. 4 restrooms (one with shower), individual entrance and individual elevator just for this office, separate server room, one small meeting room, kitchen (there is a water),general space with big meeting room and private terrace. 

Some furniture previous tenant will leave, some possible to negotiate to buy. 

3 parking places for free, to get more need to negotiate with head of service company. 

Close to 2 metro stations, a few minutes walking.

3 internet providers.

#### Comments about this office:

Nice looking building, very good location, close a few cafes, just good and simple office. 

But without emotions, for example Red bricks was like "WOW-effect", here just good and simple. 

I know this office, I was there a few times ,for your aims and targets will be good, if you don't want to get additional emotion from people, when they come to work place. I think good variant, because next door office for 790 m2 owner try to rent for 30-35 euros nowadays. Owner is a government company.They usually do not rise prices too much or make problems for tenants, but it depends. 

If compare all current variants and compare price/quality/location this one is favorite.
