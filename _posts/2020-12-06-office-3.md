## Score: 7

#### Score reason

utility: 1.5-1.7 euro per m2

internet the same price as for privious variants

Price for 1000+m2 started from 12 euros without VAT

There is no property tax for these officies.

#### Lena's comments

Not ready, needs a lot of work. We can consider other properties that are ready.

#### Advantages: 

nowadays this building like a "base" of IT companies, looks cool, close metro stations,also prestige place.


#### Disadvantages: 

office are not ready to work, all of them in this building need renovation, but because the owner is a huge developer,so all process of renovation will take more time, than if owner an individual.
Basically, it is new business center with huge advertisement pannel outside, for me nothing special, to be honest. just can be cheaper , than other variants.

#### Comments about this office:

This variant one of the most demanded on the market. There are a few available spaces: 2 floors -each 1000+ m2 and one at 3 floor - 540 m2.

Two metro stations are close to BC. Private parking. Three internet providers. 

All officies without renovation inside, but also possible to make everything in one month, also for this period will be providen "rent holidays". 

Mostly IT companies based at BC(wargaming, epam and others)
