## Score: 8

#### Lena's comments

Needs renovation , no metro station that will make commute not easy with transfers. We can find this look  new tower buildings closer to the metro.

#### Advantages: 

Good and respectable location. Nice building. Adequate and communicable individual owner. Office close to shopping mall, where employees can have dinner. A lot of light in the office.
#### Disadvantages: 

There is no metro station near. According to Belarussian tax law, we need to pay additional property tax for this office, because the owner is an individual entrepreneur, not a company(it will be additional Â±2100 euros per quarter). Need to make some renovation (floor and electricity). The owner will provide rent holidays during the period of renovation.

I'd like this variant, because of the building and atmosphere there, you feel some business spirit there,  also keep in my mind, that is not too different price with other variants.


#### Score reason

I rent office at the next door building, I can say it is really nice building and service company is good. The neibours are IT companies, Venture funds and investments companies. From all variant , that we will send you now I liked this one the most of all.

#### Comments about this office:

Building was developed in 2015. There are a four blocks. Three of them are business centers and fourth one of the biggest in Europe SPA center.

Good and quite area, a few restaurants and cafes in the same building, close to center huge shopping mall and GYM. Near bus station. From city center to BC is 15 minutes by bus. A lot of buses going to this BC regularly, there is separate bus line on the road.

Free private parking ( usually provides not more 10 places, but near  BCthere are places for cars).

There are 3 different internet providers.

Inside of the office  two rest rooms and two exits(one private). A lot of light in the office. Need to make floors and split electricity and socets. Not too hard and long process. Nowadays a lot of offices from 500 m2 without  full renovation inside. Because tenants want their own design.

Anyway period of purchasing and delivery furniture+ kitchen+partitions for meeting room will take minimum 1 month. In such case the renovation process will take 2-3 weeks.
