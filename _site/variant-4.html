IT company used to be there.</p> <h4 id="score-reason">Score reason</h4> <p>New building.</p> <p>Space splitted for a few cabinets. 4 restrooms (one with shower), individual entrance and individual elevator just for this office, separate server room, one small meeting room, kitchen (there is a water),general space with big meeting room and private terrace.</p> <p>Some furniture previous tenant will leave, some possible to negotiate to buy.</p> <p>3 parking places for free, to get more need to negotiate with head of service company.</p> <p>Close to 2 metro stations, a few minutes walking.</p> <p>3 internet providers.</p> <h4 id="comments-about-this-office">Comments about this office:</h4> <p>Nice looking building, very good location, close a few cafes, just good and simple office.</p> <p>But without emotions, for example Red bricks was like “WOW-effect”, here just good and simple.</p> <p>I know this office, I was there a few times ,for your aims and targets will be good, if you don’t want to get additional emotion from people, when they come to work place. I think good variant, because next door office for 790 m2 owner try to rent for 30-35 euros nowadays. Owner is a government company.They usually do not rise prices too much or make problems for tenants, but it depends.</p> <p>If compare all current variants and compare price/quality/location this one is favorite.</p> <h4 id="layout-plan">Layout plan:</h4> <h4 id="pictures">Pictures:</h4> <p><img src="/images/4/1.jpg" /></p> <p><img src="/images/4/2.jpg" /></p> <p><img src="/images/4/3.jpg" /></p> <p><img src="/images/4/4.jpg" /></p> <h4 id="video">Video:</h4> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
