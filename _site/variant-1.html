We can find this look new tower buildings closer to the metro.</p> <h4 id="advantages">Advantages:</h4> <p>Good and respectable location. Nice building. Adequate and communicable individual owner. Office close to shopping mall, where employees can have dinner. A lot of light in the office.</p> <h4 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages:</h4> <p>There is no metro station near. According to Belarussian tax law, we need to pay additional property tax for this office, because the owner is an individual entrepreneur, not a company(it will be additional ±2100 euros per quarter). Need to make some renovation (floor and electricity). The owner will provide rent holidays during the period of renovation.</p> <p>I’d like this variant, because of the building and atmosphere there, you feel some business spirit there, also keep in my mind, that is not too different price with other variants.</p> <h4 id="score-reason">Score reason</h4> <p>I rent office at the next door building, I can say it is really nice building and service company is good. The neibours are IT companies, Venture funds and investments companies. From all variant , that we will send you now I liked this one the most of all.</p> <h4 id="comments-about-this-office">Comments about this office:</h4> <p>Building was developed in 2015. There are a four blocks. Three of them are business centers and fourth one of the biggest in Europe SPA center.</p> <p>Good and quite area, a few restaurants and cafes in the same building, close to center huge shopping mall and GYM. Near bus station. From city center to BC is 15 minutes by bus. A lot of buses going to this BC regularly, there is separate bus line on the road.</p> <p>Free private parking ( usually provides not more 10 places, but near BCthere are places for cars).</p> <p>There are 3 different internet providers.</p> <p>Inside of the office two rest rooms and two exits(one private). A lot of light in the office. Need to make floors and split electricity and socets. Not too hard and long process. Nowadays a lot of offices from 500 m2 without full renovation inside. Because tenants want their own design.</p> <p>Anyway period of purchasing and delivery furniture+ kitchen+partitions for meeting room will take minimum 1 month. In such case the renovation process will take 2-3 weeks.</p> <h4 id="layout-plan">Layout plan:</h4> <p><img src="/images/1/Plan.jpg" /></p> <h4 id="pictures">Pictures:</h4> <p><img src="/images/1/Outside-look.jpg" /></p> <p><img src="/images/1/Outside-look-2.jpg" /></p> <p><img src="/images/1/reception.jpg" /></p> <p><img src="/images/1/Private-parking.jpg" /></p> <h4 id="video">Video:</h4> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QLC0aUn1MBY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
